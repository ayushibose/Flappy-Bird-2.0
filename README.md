# Flappy Bird: Rain Edition 🌧️🐦
A modern, feature-rich remake of the classic Flappy Bird game using **Pygame**.  
  
I added features such as **oscillating pipes, dynamic rain weather system, adaptive difficulty as game progresses**.  
Through this project, I explored features of pygame and modular game dev concept and I may expand further on this project later on.  

Requirements : python 3 and pygame should be installed.
